# SideProject
This is a website that will allow people to subscribe and receive a pun everyday

##### Website Front:
* This will be what you see when you go to punfairy.com
* This will be written in HTML 5 (most likely) and will use Materialize as a framework

##### Email List:
* This will contain the emails of the people who have subscribed to the list
* I have no current idea how this will be done (TBD)

##### Sending the puns:
* This will be a script that takes the email list and sends out the puns at a specified time everyday
* This will likely be stored somewhere else (in CST though)
* This will be written in Node
